        I'm a software engineer based in Toronto, Canada and also a
        communication and journalism student. I enjoy creating things that live
        on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in
        between. I have been freelancing for a year now while studying at the
        university and I've manage to gain a decent amount of experience and
        valuable knowledge from all different kinds of fields throughout my
        projects/work.
